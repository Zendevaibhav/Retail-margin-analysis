# Retail Store Performance & Discount Impact Analysis.

## Project Background.

Retail businesses often rely on aggressive discounting and high sales volumes to drive growth. However, increased sales do not always translate into higher profitability, especially when discounts, shipping costs, and regional operations are not closely monitored. This project analyzes regional, product, and operational performance to understand how discount strategies and shipping decisions affect profit margins and overall business sustainability.

## Overview :-

This analysis examines retail store performance across multiple regions, focusing on profitability, discount strategies, product mix, and operational efficiency. Key findings are visualized through an interactive dashboard, with selected charts and screenshots included throughout the report for clarity.
Full interactive dashboard can be accessed here 

## Objective & scope :-

The analysis aims to identify key drivers of profitability, assess the impact of discounting on profit margins, and highlight operational inefficiencies across regions, product categories, and shipping modes. Department-specific insights and actionable recommendations are provided for leadership, finance, operations, and sales teams to support data-driven decision-making.

## Executive Summary :-

- Overall profitability is positive but varies significantly by region, category, and shipping mode. 
- Discounts beyond mid-range levels consistently reduce profit margins.
- Certain high-volume states show negative profitability, indicating state-specific operational and pricing challenges.
- Not all top-performing sub-categories contribute positively to profits, highlighting the need for strategic portfolio management.

## Department-Wise Insights & Recommendations :-

### 1] Leadership / Executive

- **Insight:**
Overall revenue is positive, but margin analysis shows certain high-sales regions, such as the South, are generating negative profits.

- **Recommendation:**
Focus on margin-led growth targets rather than revenue alone to ensure sustainable profitability.

### 2] Finance

- **Insight:**
Profit margins decline sharply for discounts above **20–25%** across multiple categories. High-discount transactions are eroding overall profitability.

- **Recommendation:**
Implement discount approval thresholds and monitor high-discount transactions to protect margins.

### 3] Operations / Supply Chain

- **Insight:**
Same Day shipping in the South region reports **-8.39%** profit margin, primarily driven by **North Carolina** and **Tennessee**. Other high-volume states, such as Texas and Ohio, also show negative margins under high discount levels.

- **Recommendation:**
Conduct state-level operational reviews and adjust shipping costs or policies in high-loss areas to improve overall profitability.

### 4] Sales / Category Management
- **Insight:**
Certain top-selling sub-categories, such as **Bookcases** and **Tables**, show low or negative profit margins despite comparable sales volumes. Product performance varies significantly even among top-selling items, and across the three major product categories, one category consistently underperforms while the other two maintain healthy margins.

- **Recommendation:**
Prioritize high-margin products in promotions and adjust sales strategies to improve overall profitability. Revisit discount allocations at the sub-category and category level to limit margin erosion.

## Key Takeaways

- Discount strategies have a greater impact on profitability than raw sales growth.

- Operational inefficiencies are often localized, and targeted interventions can improve margins.

- Portfolio and regional focus can improve profitability without increasing overall sales.

- Recommendations are tailored for each department to support data-driven decision-making.
